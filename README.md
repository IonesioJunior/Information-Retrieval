Information Retrieval is a concept that wants to study about how we can extract some information of text documents and how we can represent this relation between words/phrases and documents.

## What Questions we want to ask?

### How to retrieve a text document by query?
 - How to store this documents?
 - How to know what documents have some word?
 - How to build the structure that represents this relation between query and documents?

### How to turn this system most efficiently
 - How to determine what document is most similar to the query?
 - Have different ways to determine similarity between documents?
 - Have some way to suggest new queries?
 - How to evaluate this efficiency?

### How to ranking Web Pages?
 - Links between web pages have some impact to search results?
 - How to define a ranking to web pages?
 - How to build this ranking?
